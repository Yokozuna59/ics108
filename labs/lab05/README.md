# Lab 05

## Task

1. **Question Discription:**

    Design a class Named **Point** to represent a point with $x$ and $y$-coordinates.

    The class contains:

      - The data fields $x$ and $y$ that represent the coordinates with getter methods.
      - A no-argument constructor that creates a point $(0, 0)$.
      - A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates.
      - A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to a specified point of the **Point** type.

    Write a test program that creates the two point $(0, 0)$ using the no-argument constructor and $(10, 30.5)$ and displays the distance between them using the distance method.

**My Solution**: [Task.java](Task.java)
