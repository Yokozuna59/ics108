# Lab 01

## Task 1

1. **Question Discription:**

    A regular polygon is an $n$-sided polygon in which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). The formula for computing the area of a regular polygon is

    $$Area = \frac{n \times s^2}{4 \times tan\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)}$$

    **Note**: $s$ is the length of a side. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and their length of a regular polygon and displays its area.

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    Enter the number of sides: **5**<br>
    Enter the side: **6.5**<br>
    The area of the polygon is 72.69017017488385

## Task 2

1. **Question Discription:**

    Write a program that finds the GPA of a section. First read the number of students. Then read the letter grades.

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    How many students?<br>
    **3**<br>
    Enter 3 letter grades:<br>
    **A+**<br>
    **B**<br>
    **A**<br>
    GPA = 3.583333
