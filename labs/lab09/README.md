## Task

1. **Question Discription:**

    - Create a subclass of `Question` called `MCQuestion` that contains additional fields for choices.
    - Provide a constructor that has all the fields.
    - Override the `toString()` method to return all data fields (use the `toString()` method of the Question class).

    Write a test program that creates a `MCQuestion` object with values of your choice.<br>
    Print the object using the `toString` method.

**My Solution**: [Task.java](Task.java)
