Design a class named Employee and its two subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee.
An Employee has ID and name.
A  FullTimeEmployee has salary.
A PartTimeEmployee has hours.

Include in each class a constructor that has all the data fields and override the toString method to return the data fields.

Write a test program that creates an array of type Employee. Fill the array with objects from the subclasses only. Finally, print the PartTimeEmployees followed by the average hours, then print the FullTimeEmployees followed by the average salary.
