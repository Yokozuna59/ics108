## Task

1. **Question Discription:**

    - Create a class called `Vehicle` that contains fields for the vehicle's `id` and `wheels`.
    - Provide suitable constructors.
    - Override the `toString()` method to return all data fields.
    Create a subclass of `Vehicle` called `Truck` that contains a field for `load` (tonnage).
    - Override the `toString()` method to return all data fields (use the `toString()` method of the `Vehicle` class).

    Write a test program that creates a `Truck` object and a `Vehicle` object with values of your choice.<br>
    Print the two object using the `toString()` method.

**My Solution**: [Task.java](Task.java)
